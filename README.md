# Feature_Extracting_using_the_Bag_of_Word_Model

## I have performed the text data feature extracting using the Bag of Word (BoW) model. The dataset I used is SMS Spam Collection consisting of 5,574 instances with 2 classes of Spam and Ham (non-spam) available at UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and could be obtained from “https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection”. The data folder of “sms+spam+collection.zip” consists of 2 files “readme” and “SMSSpamCollection”. The “readme” consists of dataset description, format, references, and the “SMSSpamCollection” is the dataset.
